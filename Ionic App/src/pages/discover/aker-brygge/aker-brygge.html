          <p>Aker Brygge is known for its strip of restaurants along the boardwalk, with plenty of opportunities for al fresco wining and dining. <br>
            There's also a wide selection of fashion shops, if you want to renew your wardrobe. <br>On sunny days, Aker Brygge is teeming with activity round the clock, and it doesn't cost you anything to wander along the quay and enjoy the fresh sea air.<br>
